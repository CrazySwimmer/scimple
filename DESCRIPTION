Description: Methods for obtaining simultaneous confidence intervals for multinomial 
    proportions have been proposed by many authors and the present study include a variety 
    of widely applicable procedures. Seven classical methods (Wilson, Quesenberry and 
    Hurst, Goodman, Wald with and without continuity correction, Fitzpatrick and Scott, 
    Sison and Glaz) and Bayesian Dirichlet models are included in the package. The 
    advantage of MCMC pack has been exploited to derive the Dirichlet posterior directly 
    and this also helps in handling the Dirichlet prior parameters. This package is 
    prepared to have equal and unequal values for the Dirichlet prior distribution that 
    will provide better scope for data analysis and associated sensitivity analysis.
